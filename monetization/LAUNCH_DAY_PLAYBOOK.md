```
After 6 months of building, I'm launching SignSimple.io today.

It's the simplest way to get documents signed online.

No enterprise complexity. No per-signature fees. Just upload, add fields, send.

To celebrate launch, the first 200 users get lifetime access for $59 (one-time).

After that, it's $19/month.

If you send contracts, agreements, or any documents that need signatures - this is for you.

### 10:00 AM - Indie Hackers Post
Title: "Launched: SignSimple.io - Get documents signed for $59 (lifetime)"

```
Hey IH!

After lurking here for years, I finally launched something.

**What is it?**
SignSimple.io - A simple e-signature tool. Upload PDF, add signature fields, send. Recipients sign from any device.

**Why build another e-signature tool?**
DocuSign charges $25/mo minimum. HelloSign is $15/mo. For freelancers and small businesses sending a few documents, that adds up fast. I wanted something affordable.

**The offer:**
First 200 users get lifetime access for $59. After that, it's $19/month.

**What I'd love from you:**
- Feedback on the landing page
- Any features you'd want to see
- Honest criticism welcome

Thanks for reading!

**r/Entrepreneur:**
```
Title: Launched my SaaS today - $59 lifetime deal for first 200 users

Building in public update: Just launched SignSimple.io after 6 months.

It's an e-signature tool for freelancers and small businesses. Upload a doc, add signature fields, send. Simple.

Doing a lifetime deal for launch: $59 one-time instead of $19/month.

Not here to spam - genuinely curious what you think of the landing page and if the value prop is clear.

## FOMO TACTICS (Ethical)

### DO:
- Show real-time spots remaining
- Share actual testimonials
- Post sales milestones (50% sold, 100 left, etc.)
- Create genuine countdown to deadline
- Highlight the math ($59 vs $228/year)

### DON'T:
- Fake urgency (saying sold out when it's not)
- Fake testimonials
- Hidden "extensions" of the deal
- Pressure tactics that feel scammy
- Spamming communities

### FOMO Content Templates:

**Milestone Post:**
```
[X] founders have joined SignSimple.io in [Y] hours.

[Z] lifetime spots remaining.

These early believers will never pay monthly fees. Ever.

Join them: [link]
```

**Social Proof Post:**
```
Just got this DM:

"Bought the lifetime deal. Already sent 3 contracts. This is exactly what I needed."

Love hearing this. [X] spots left: [link]
```

**Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):**
```
Quick math:

$59 lifetime deal today = $59 total, forever

$19/month starting next week = $228/year, every year

In 3 months, the lifetime deal pays for itself.
